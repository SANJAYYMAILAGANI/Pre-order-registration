📌 Project Title: Pre-Order Registration System

🧠 Objective:
To build a web-based platform where users can vote for their preferred device to be made available in an upcoming sale, helping businesses prioritize popular products and gauge demand.

🧰 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

⚙️ Key Features:
User Voting Interface:

Clean, intuitive UI where users can select and vote for a device from a list.

Devices displayed with images and basic info (brand, model, specs).

Vote Handling Logic:

Votes are submitted via an HTML form to the backend using PHP.

Each vote is recorded in the MySQL database, ensuring data integrity.

Real-Time Results Display:

Votes are counted dynamically and displayed with progress bars or charts.

Users can see live updates of which device is most popular.

Duplicate Vote Prevention (Optional/Stretch Feature):

Logic can be added to limit users to one vote per session/email/IP to prevent misuse.

🧪 Development Process:
Designed responsive UI using Bootstrap.

Created a MySQL schema to store device names and vote counts.

Wrote PHP scripts for:

Connecting to the database

Submitting and updating vote counts

Fetching data for live result visualization

Tested application locally using XAMPP or WAMP.

📈 Outcome:
Demonstrated integration of frontend and backend technologies in a real-world application.

Gained practical experience in:

Form handling and server-side scripting

Dynamic content rendering

Delivered a user-friendly, functional system useful for marketing, product launches, or surveys.

💡 Future Improvements (Ideas):
Add user login for personalized voting.
